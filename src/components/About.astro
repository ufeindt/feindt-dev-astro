    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a knack for solving problems
        with automation. Formerly worked as a research scientist in
        astrophysics. Currently working mainly with Python, specifically Django,
        and using Heroku and Shopify to enable e-commerce.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love tackling challenging problems, not just in order to solve them,
        but also because of the new methods I may have to learn or develop, and
        the fascinating people I might meet through collaboration.
